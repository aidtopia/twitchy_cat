# Twitchy Cat
Adrian McCarthy (mechanics)  
Suzanne Coberly (corpsing)  
based on Oak Lane Cemetery's [Undead Kitty][1]

## The Effect

A rotting corpse of a cat sporadically kicks its hind legs.  It's gruesome and may bother cat lovers.

## Documentation

* [Assembly][2]
* [Corpsing][3]

## Parts

The assembly and corpsing instructions contain lists of all the parts and supplies used for our version.

There are two additional parts that can be printed with a 3D printer.  They are optional, but highly recommended if you're trying to replicate our version.

* Twitchy Cat Link ([STL][4] [SCAD][5]) simplifies fabrication of a reliable linkage
* Handheld Button ([STL][6] [SCAD][7]) provides a tidy case for a push button controller

Oak Lane Cemetery used a prop controller circuit from Jekyll-Labs.  As of this writing, Jekyll-Labs offers a newer version of that circuit called the [Twitchboard][8].
