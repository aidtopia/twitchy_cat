## The Effect
A rotting corpse of a cat, lying its side sporadically kicks its hind legs.  It's gruesome and may bother cat lovers.

## Parts

* Cat Skeleton https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OXD4S5S
* Car door lock actuator with hardware
* 3/4" or 1" hinge with screws

Note that I've received two different models of the cat skeleton even though I ordered from the same link.  They are very similar, but there are some small differences between them.

## Tools

* Philips screwdrivers, #0 and #1
* awl, punch, or drill with 1/16" bit to 

## Steps

### Posing the Tail
The tail is rubbery and has a slight curl.  If it's curling down and you want it up:

* Loosen the two screws that hold the hips together, using a philips #0 screwdriver (manual, not electric).
* My skeleton also had a zip tip that I needed to snip.
* The right side of the hip and its leg should pull off.
* The left leg will now swivel, revealing another small screw into the side of the spine just above where the tail attaches.  Loosen that and remove the hip.
* Now you can remove the tail, turn it around and reassemble.

Pro tip:  Consider postponing reassembly of the hips until after you've got the spine hinged.

### Breaking the Back

Just behind the last ribs, we're going to sever the spine and then reconnect it so that it's hinged.  In mine, there was already a slit between the appropriate vertabrea.  You can easily cut through the spine with a small handsaw, like a hacksaw, coping saw, Japanese pull saw, etc.  I used a Dremel rotary tool on low speed with a generic cutting disk and it went right through.  Try not to breath the plastic dust.

### Adding the Articulation

I used a small 1" wide hinge to re-attach the severed spine.  A 3/4" wide hinge might be even better.  Open the hinge and position it across the cut so that the flat side is against the spine and the pin is perpendicular to it.  Holding the hinge against the spine, mark where the screw positions.  Drill _tiny_ starter holes (not even pilot holes) and screw the hinge using the included screws.

Another option:  Drill holes through the two ends of the spine and zip tie it loosely enough that you can bend the spine at the cut.

Another option:  Attach a narrow strip of robust cloth to the underside of two ends of the spine.  You might want to use glue and/or small screws through the cloth and into the spine.

Whichever method you use, the spine should now bend freely so that the hind legs can swing forward a couple inches.

### Install the Actuator

Insert the actuator into the rib cage, wires first.  Guide the wires through the collar bone.  The cylindrical part of the actuator should point up toward the spine.  Secure the actuator to the sternum with zip ties between the ribs.  For best results, feed the zip ties in from the cat's right side.  When you cinch up the ties, the zipper part should be on the cat's right side.

The actuator is an inexpensive "universal" replacement for cars with electronic locks in the doors.  They run on 12 VDC and will draw quite a bit of current.  The tip moves about 3/4" quite quickly.  Do not leave the actuator energized for more than a second or so, as that could cause the motor to overheat.  The wires are blue and green.  If you apply the postive voltage to the blue and the common to the green, the actuator will extend.  If you reverse the polarity, the actuator will retract.

Using two relays of a prop controller, you can operate the actuator in each direction.  But we'll be borrowing Oak Lane Cemetery's design and set it up just to extend (causing the hind legs to kick) and use a spring to retract.
